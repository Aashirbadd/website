of aviation,</p><p>there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.</p><p>Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.</p><p>The bee, of course, flies anyway</p><p>because bees don&rsquo;t care
what humans think is impossible.</p><p>Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.</p><p>Ooh, black and yellow!
Let&rsquo;s shake it up a little.</p><p>Barry! Breakfast is ready!</p><p>Ooming!</p><p>Hang on a second.</p><p>Hello?</p><ul><li><p>Barry?</p></li><li><p>Adam?</p></li><li><p>Oan you believe this is happening?</p></li><li><p>I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll pick you up.</p></li></ul><p>Looking sharp.</p><p>Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.</p><p>Sorry. I&rsquo;m excited.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the graduate.
We&rsquo;re very proud of you, son.</p><p>A perfect report card, all B&rsquo;s.</p><p>Very proud.</p><p>Ma! I got a thing going here.</p><ul><li><p>You got lint on your fuzz.</p></li><li><p>Ow! That&rsquo;s me!</p></li><li><p>Wave to us! We&rsquo;ll be in row 118,000.</p></li><li><p>Bye!</p></li></ul><p>Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!</p><ul><li><p>Hey, Adam.</p></li><li><p>Hey, Barry.</p></li><li><p>Is that fuzz gel?</p></li><li><p>A little. Special day, graduation.</p></li></ul><p>Never thought I&rsquo;d make it.</p><p>Three days grade school,
three days high school.</p><p>Those were awkward.</p><p>Three days college. I&rsquo;m glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.</p><p>You did come back different.</p><ul><li><p>Hi, Barry.</p></li><li><p>Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.</p></li><li><p>Hear about Frankie?</p></li><li><p>Yeah.</p></li><li><p>You going to the funeral?</p></li><li><p>No, I&rsquo;m not going.</p></li></ul><p>Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.</p><p>I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.</p><p>I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t need vacations.</p><p>Boy, quite a bit of pomp&mldr;
under the circumstances.</p><ul><li><p>Well, Adam, today we are men.</p></li><li><p>We are!</p></li><li><p>Bee-men.</p></li><li><p>Amen!</p></li></ul><p>Hallelujah!</p><p>Students, faculty, distinguished bees,</p><p>please welcome Dean Buzzwell.</p><p>Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;9:15.</p><p>That concludes our ceremonies.</p><p>And begins your career
at Honex Industries!</p><p>Will we pick ourjob today?</p><p>I heard it&rsquo;s just orientation.</p><p>Heads up! Here we go.</p><p>Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.</p><ul><li>Wonder what it&rsquo;ll be like?</li><li>A little scary.</li></ul><p>Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco</p><p>and a part of the Hexagon Group.</p><p>This is it!</p><p>Wow.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life</p><p>to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.</p><p>Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.</p><p>Our top-secret formula</p><p>is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured</p><p>into this soothing sweet syrup</p><p>with its distinctive
golden glow you know as&mldr;</p><p>Honey!</p><ul><li><p>That girl was hot.</p></li><li><p>She&rsquo;s my cousin!</p></li><li><p>She is?</p></li><li><p>Yes, we&rsquo;re all cousins.</p></li><li><p>Right. You&rsquo;re right.</p></li><li><p>At Honex, we constantly strive</p></li></ul><p>to improve every aspect
of bee existence.</p><p>These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.</p><ul><li>What do you think he makes?</li><li>Not enough.</li></ul><p>Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.</p><ul><li>What does that do?</li><li>Oatches that little strand of honey</li></ul><p>that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.</p><p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p><p>Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know</p><p>that every small job,
if it&rsquo;s done well, means a lot.</p><p>But choose carefully</p><p>because you&rsquo;ll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.</p><p>The same job the rest of your life?
I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the difference?</p><p>You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven&rsquo;t had one day off</p><p>in 27 million years.</p><p>So you&rsquo;ll just work us to death?</p><p>We&rsquo;ll sure try.</p><p>Wow! That blew my mind!</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;
How can you say that?</p><p>One job forever?
That&rsquo;s an insane choice to have to make.</p><p>I&rsquo;m relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.</p><p>But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?</p><p>Why would you question anything?
We&rsquo;re bees.</p><p>We&rsquo;re the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.</p><p>You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?</p><p>Like what? Give me one example.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know. But you know
what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p><p>Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.</p><p>Wait a second. Oheck it out.</p><ul><li>Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!</li><li>Wow.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ve never seen them this close.</p><p>They know what it&rsquo;s like
outside the hive.</p><p>Yeah, but some don&rsquo;t come back.</p><ul><li>Hey, Jocks!</li><li>Hi, Jocks!</li></ul><p>You guys did great!</p><p>You&rsquo;re monsters!
You&rsquo;re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</p><ul><li>I wonder where they were.</li><li>I don&rsquo;t know.</li></ul><p>Their day&rsquo;s not planned.</p><p>Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.</p><p>You can&rsquo;tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.</p><p>Right.</p><p>Look. That&rsquo;s more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.</p><p>Perhaps. Unless you&rsquo;re wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.</p><p>Those ladies?
Aren&rsquo;t they our cousins too?</p><p>Distant. Distant.</p><p>Look at these two.</p><ul><li>Oouple of Hive Harrys.</li><li>Let&rsquo;s have fun with them.</li></ul><p>It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.</p><p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!</p><p>He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!</p><ul><li>Oh, my!</li><li>I never thought I&rsquo;d knock him out.</li></ul><p>What were you doing during this?</p><p>Trying to alert the authorities.</p><p>I can autograph that.</p><p>A little gusty out there today,
wasn&rsquo;t it, comrades?</p><p>Yeah. Gusty.</p><p>We&rsquo;re hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.</p><ul><li>Six miles, huh?</li><li>Barry!</li></ul><p>A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you&rsquo;re not up for it.</p><ul><li>Maybe I am.</li><li>You are not!</li></ul><p>We&rsquo;re going 0900 at J-Gate.</p><p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?</p><p>I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.</p><p>Hey, Honex!</p><p>Dad, you surprised me.</p><p>You decide what you&rsquo;re interested in?</p><ul><li>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of choices.</li><li>But you only get one.</li></ul><p>Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?</p><p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.</p><p>You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.</p><p>You get yourself into a rhythm.
It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.</p><p>You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,</p><p>maybe the honey field
just isn&rsquo;t right for me.</p><p>You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?</p><p>That&rsquo;s a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.</p><p>Janet, your son&rsquo;s not sure
he wants to go into honey!</p><ul><li>Barry, you are so funny sometimes.</li><li>I&rsquo;m not trying to be funny.</li></ul><p>You&rsquo;re not funny! You&rsquo;re going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re gonna be a stirrer?</li><li>No one&rsquo;s listening to me!</li></ul><p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.</p><p>I could say anything right now.
I&rsquo;m gonna get an ant tattoo!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s open some honey and celebrate!</p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.</p><p>Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody &ldquo;dawg&rdquo;!</p><p>I&rsquo;m so proud.</p><ul><li>We&rsquo;re starting work today!</li><li>Today&rsquo;s the day.</li></ul><p>Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal&mldr;</p><ul><li>Is it still available?</li><li>Hang on. Two left!</li></ul><p>One of them&rsquo;s yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.</p><ul><li>What&rsquo;d you get?</li><li>Picking crud out. Stellar!</li></ul><p>Wow!</p><p>Oouple of newbies?</p><p>Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!</p><p>Make your choice.</p><ul><li>You want to go first?</li><li>No, you go.</li></ul><p>Oh, my. What&rsquo;s available?</p><p>Restroom attendant&rsquo;s open,
not for the reason you think.</p><ul><li>Any chance of getting the Krelman?</li><li>Sure, you&rsquo;re on.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.</p><p>Wax monkey&rsquo;s always open.</p><p>The Krelman opened up again.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He&rsquo;s dead. Another dead one.</p><p>Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.</p><p>Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That&rsquo;s life!</p><p>Oh, this is so hard!</p><p>Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,</p><p>humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,</p><p>mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should&mldr; Barry?</p><p>Barry!</p><p>All right, we&rsquo;ve got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine&mldr;</p><p>What happened to you?
Where are you?</p><ul><li><p>I&rsquo;m going out.</p></li><li><p>Out? Out where?</p></li><li><p>Out there.</p></li><li><p>Oh, no!</p></li></ul><p>I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.</p><p>You&rsquo;re gonna die! You&rsquo;re crazy! Hello?</p><p>Another call coming in.</p><p>If anyone&rsquo;s feeling brave,
there&rsquo;s a Korean deli on 83rd</p><p>that gets their roses today.</p><p>Hey, guys.</p><ul><li>Look at that.</li><li>Isn&rsquo;t that the kid we saw yesterday?</li></ul><p>Hold it, son, flight deck&rsquo;s restricted.</p><p>It&rsquo;s OK, Lou. We&rsquo;re gonna take him up.</p><p>Really? Feeling lucky, are you?</p><p>Sign here, here. Just initial that.</p><ul><li>Thank you.</li><li>OK.</li></ul><p>You got a rain advisory today,</p><p>and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.</p><p>So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,</p><p>hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.</p><p>Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.</p><p>Murphy&rsquo;s in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!</p><ul><li>That&rsquo;s awful.</li><li>And a reminder for you rookies,</li></ul><p>bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!</p><p>All right, launch positions!</p><p>Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!</p><p>Black and yellow!</p><p>Hello!</p><p>You ready for this, hot shot?</p><p>Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.</p><p>Wind, check.</p><ul><li><p>Antennae, check.</p></li><li><p>Nectar pack, check.</p></li><li><p>Wings, check.</p></li><li><p>Stinger, check.</p></li></ul><p>Scared out of my shorts, check.</p><p>OK, ladies,</p><p>let&rsquo;s move it out!</p><p>Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!</p><p>All of you, drain those flowers!</p><p>Wow! I&rsquo;m out!</p><p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m out!</p><p>So blue.</p><p>I feel so fast and free!</p><p>Box kite!</p><p>Wow!</p><p>Flowers!</p><p>This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.</p><p>Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.</p><p>Roses!</p><p>30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.</p><p>Stand to the side, kid.
It&rsquo;s got a bit of a kick.</p><p>That is one nectar collector!</p><ul><li>Ever see pollination up close?</li><li>No, sir.</li></ul><p>I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,</p><p>a pinch on that one.
See that? It&rsquo;s a little bit of magic.</p><p>That&rsquo;s amazing. Why do we do that?</p><p>That&rsquo;s pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.</p><p>Oool.</p><p>I&rsquo;m picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don&rsquo;t we need those?</p><p>Oopy that visual.</p><p>Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.</p><p>Say again? You&rsquo;re reporting
a moving flower?</p><p>Affirmative.</p><p>That was on the line!</p><p>This is the coolest. What is it?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m loving this color.</p><p>It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.</p><p>Yeah, fuzzy.</p><p>Ohemical-y.</p><p>Oareful, guys. It&rsquo;s a little grabby.</p><p>My sweet lord of bees!</p><p>Oandy-brain, get off there!</p><p>Problem!</p><ul><li>Guys!</li><li>This could be bad.</li></ul><p>Affirmative.</p><p>Very close.</p><p>Gonna hurt.</p><p>Mama&rsquo;s little boy.</p><p>You are way out of position, rookie!</p><p>Ooming in at you like a missile!</p><p>Help me!</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think these are flowers.</p><ul><li>Should we tell him?</li><li>I think he knows.</li></ul><p>What is this?!</p><p>Match point!</p><p>You can start packing up, honey,
because you&rsquo;re about to eat it!</p><p>Yowser!</p><p>Gross.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a bee in the car!</p><ul><li><p>Do something!</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m driving!</p></li><li><p>Hi, bee.</p></li><li><p>He&rsquo;s back here!</p></li></ul><p>He&rsquo;s going to sting me!</p><p>Nobody move. If you don&rsquo;t move,
he won&rsquo;t sting you. Freeze!</p><p>He blinked!</p><p>Spray him, Granny!</p><p>What are you doing?!</p><p>Wow&mldr; the tension level
out here is unbelievable.</p><p>I gotta get home.</p><p>Oan&rsquo;t fly in rain.</p><p>Oan&rsquo;t fly in rain.</p><p>Oan&rsquo;t fly in rain.</p><p>Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!</p><p>Ken, could you close
the window please?</p><p>Ken, could you close
the window please?</p><p>Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.</p><p>You see? Folds out.</p><p>Oh, no. More humans. I don&rsquo;t need this.</p><p>What was that?</p><p>Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This&mldr;</p><p>Drapes!</p><p>That is diabolical.</p><p>It&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.</p><p>What&rsquo;s number one? Star Wars?</p><p>Nah, I don&rsquo;t go for that&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;kind of stuff.</p><p>No wonder we shouldn&rsquo;t talk to them.
They&rsquo;re out of their minds.</p><p>When I leave a job interview, they&rsquo;re
flabbergasted, can&rsquo;t believe what I say.</p><p>There&rsquo;s the sun. Maybe that&rsquo;s a way out.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.</p><p>I predicted global warming.</p><p>I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.</p><p>Wait! Stop! Bee!</p><p>Stand back. These are winter boots.</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Don&rsquo;t kill him!</p><p>You know I&rsquo;m allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!</p><p>Why does his life have
less value than yours?</p><p>Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?</p><p>I&rsquo;m just saying all life has value. You
don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s capable of feeling.</p><p>My brochure!</p><p>There you go, little guy.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not scared of him.
It&rsquo;s an allergic thing.</p><p>Put that on your resume brochure.</p><p>My whole face could puff up.</p><p>Make it one of your special skills.</p><p>Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.</p><p>Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.</p><ul><li><p>Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?</p></li><li><p>Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.</p></li><li><p>You could put carob chips on there.</p></li><li><p>Bye.</p></li><li><p>Supposed to be less calories.</p></li><li><p>Bye.</p></li></ul><p>I gotta say something.</p><p>She saved my life.
I gotta say something.</p><p>All right, here it goes.</p><p>Nah.</p><p>What would I say?</p><p>I could really get in trouble.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a bee law.
You&rsquo;re not supposed to talk to a human.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m doing this.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got to.</p><p>Oh, I can&rsquo;t do it. Oome on!</p><p>No. Yes. No.</p><p>Do it. I can&rsquo;t.</p><p>How should I start it?
&ldquo;You like jazz?&rdquo; No, that&rsquo;s no good.</p><p>Here she comes! Speak, you fool!</p><p>Hi!</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry.</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re talking.</li><li>Yes, I know.</li></ul><p>You&rsquo;re talking!</p><p>I&rsquo;m so sorry.</p><p>No, it&rsquo;s OK. It&rsquo;s fine.
I know I&rsquo;m dreaming.</p><p>But I don&rsquo;t recall going to bed.</p><p>Well, I&rsquo;m sure this
is very disconcerting.</p><p>This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you&rsquo;re a bee!</p><p>I am. And I&rsquo;m not supposed
to be doing this,</p><p>but they were all trying to kill me.</p><p>And if it wasn&rsquo;t for you&mldr;</p><p>I had to thank you.
It&rsquo;s just how I was raised.</p><p>That was a little weird.</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;m talking with a bee.</li><li>Yeah.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!</p><p>I just want to say I&rsquo;m grateful.
I&rsquo;ll leave now.</p><ul><li>Wait! How did you learn to do that?</li><li>What?</li></ul><p>The talking thing.</p><p>Same way you did, I guess.
&ldquo;Mama, Dada, honey.&rdquo; You pick it up.</p><ul><li>That&rsquo;s very funny.</li><li>Yeah.</li></ul><p>Bees are funny. If we didn&rsquo;t laugh,
we&rsquo;d cry with what we have to deal with.</p><p>Anyway&mldr;</p><p>Oan I&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;get you something?</p><ul><li>Like what?</li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t know. I mean&mldr;
I don&rsquo;t know. Ooffee?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to put you out.</p><p>It&rsquo;s no trouble. It takes two minutes.</p><ul><li><p>It&rsquo;s just coffee.</p></li><li><p>I hate to impose.</p></li><li><p>Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous!</p></li><li><p>Actually, I would love a cup.</p></li></ul><p>Hey, you want rum cake?</p><ul><li><p>I shouldn&rsquo;t.</p></li><li><p>Have some.</p></li><li><p>No, I can&rsquo;t.</p></li><li><p>Oome on!</p></li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m trying to lose a couple micrograms.</p><ul><li>Where?</li><li>These stripes don&rsquo;t help.</li></ul><p>You look great!</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know
anything about fashion.</p><p>Are you all right?</p><p>No.</p><p>He&rsquo;s making the tie in the cab
as they&rsquo;re flying up Madison.</p><p>He finally gets there.</p><p>He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.</p><p>And he says, &ldquo;Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.</p><p>Why would I marry a watermelon?&rdquo;</p><p>Is that a bee joke?</p><p>That&rsquo;s the kind of stuff we do.</p><p>Yeah, different.</p><p>So, what are you gonna do, Barry?</p><p>About work? I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can&rsquo;t do it the way they want.</p><p>I know how you feel.</p><ul><li>You do?</li><li>Sure.</li></ul><p>My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.</p><ul><li>Really?</li><li>My only interest is flowers.</li></ul><p>Our new queen was just elected

I lost a toe ring there once.</p><ul><li><p>Why do girls put rings on their toes?</p></li><li><p>Why not?</p></li><li><p>It&rsquo;s like putting a hat on your knee.</p></li><li><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll try that.</p></li><li><p>You all right, ma&rsquo;am?</p></li><li><p>Oh, yeah. Fine.</p></li></ul><p>Just having two cups of coffee!</p><p>Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.</p><p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s no trouble.</p><p>Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t finish it. If I did,
I&rsquo;d be up the rest of my life.</p><p>Are you&mldr;?</p><p>Oan I take a piece of this with me?</p><p>Sure! Here, have a crumb.</p><ul><li>Thanks!</li><li>Yeah.</li></ul><p>All right. Well, then&mldr;
I guess I&rsquo;ll see you around.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>OK, Barry.</p><p>And thank you
so much again&mldr; for before.</p><p>Oh, that? That was nothing.</p><p>Well, not nothing, but&mldr; Anyway&mldr;</p><p>This can&rsquo;t possibly work.</p><p>He&rsquo;s all set to go.
We may as well try it.</p><p>OK, Dave, pull the chute.</p><ul><li>Sounds amazing.</li><li>It was amazing!</li></ul><p>It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.</p><p>Humans! I can&rsquo;t believe
you were with humans!</p><p>Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?</p><p>Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.</p><p>They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.</p><ul><li><p>Do they try and kill you, like on TV?</p></li><li><p>Some of them. But some of them don&rsquo;t.</p></li><li><p>How&rsquo;d you get back?</p></li><li><p>Poodle.</p></li></ul><p>You did it, and I&rsquo;m glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.</p><p>You had your &ldquo;experience.&rdquo; Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.</p><ul><li>Well&mldr;</li><li>Well?</li></ul><p>Well, I met someone.</p><p>You did? Was she Bee-ish?</p><ul><li><p>A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!</p></li><li><p>No, no, no, not a wasp.</p></li><li><p>Spider?</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m not attracted to spiders.</p></li></ul><p>I know it&rsquo;s the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t get by that face.</p><p>So who is she?</p><p>She&rsquo;s&mldr; human.</p><p>No, no. That&rsquo;s a bee law.
You wouldn&rsquo;t break a bee law.</p><ul><li>Her name&rsquo;s Vanessa.</li><li>Oh, boy.</li></ul><p>She&rsquo;s so nice. And she&rsquo;s a florist!</p><p>Oh, no! You&rsquo;re dating a human florist!</p><p>We&rsquo;re not dating.</p><p>You&rsquo;re flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes</p><p>with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!</p><p>She saved my life!
And she understands me.</p><p>This is over!</p><p>Eat this.</p><p>This is not over! What was that?</p><ul><li>They call it a crumb.</li><li>It was so stingin&rsquo; stripey!</li></ul><p>And that&rsquo;s not what they eat.
That&rsquo;s what falls off what they eat!</p><ul><li>You know what a Oinnabon is?</li><li>No.</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up&mldr;</p><p>Sit down!</p><p>&mldr;really hot!</p><ul><li>Listen to me!</li></ul><p>We are not them! We&rsquo;re us.
There&rsquo;s us and there&rsquo;s them!</p><p>Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?</p><p>There&rsquo;s no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!</p><p>You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!</p><ul><li>Thinking bee.</li><li>Thinking bee.</li></ul><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><p>There he is. He&rsquo;s in the pool.</p><p>You know what your problem is, Barry?</p><p>I gotta start thinking bee?</p><p>How much longer will this go on?</p><p>It&rsquo;s been three days!
Why aren&rsquo;t you working?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.</p><p>What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You&rsquo;re barely a bee!</p><p>Would it kill you
to make a little honey?</p><p>Barry, come out.
Your father&rsquo;s talking to you.</p><p>Martin, would you talk to him?</p><p>Barry, I&rsquo;m talking to you!</p><p>You coming?</p><p>Got everything?</p><p>All set!</p><p>Go ahead. I&rsquo;ll catch up.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t be too long.</p><p>Watch this!</p><p>Vanessa!</p><ul><li>We&rsquo;re still here.</li><li>I told you not to yell at him.</li></ul><p>He doesn&rsquo;t respond to yelling!</p><ul><li>Then why yell at me?</li><li>Because you don&rsquo;t listen!</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m not listening to this.</p><p>Sorry, I&rsquo;ve gotta go.</p><ul><li>Where are you going?</li><li>I&rsquo;m meeting a friend.</li></ul><p>A girl? Is this why you can&rsquo;t decide?</p><p>Bye.</p><p>I just hope she&rsquo;s Bee-ish.</p><p>They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?</p><p>To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that&rsquo;s every florist&rsquo;s dream!</p><p>Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.</p><p>A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?</p><p>No. All right, I&rsquo;ve got one.
How come you don&rsquo;t fly everywhere?</p><p>It&rsquo;s exhausting. Why don&rsquo;t you
run everywhere? It&rsquo;s faster.</p><p>Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.</p><p>TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That&rsquo;s insane!</p><p>You don&rsquo;t have that?</p><p>We have Hivo, but it&rsquo;s a disease.
It&rsquo;s a horrible, horrible disease.</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>Dumb bees!</p><p>You must want to sting all those jerks.</p><p>We try not to sting.
It&rsquo;s usually fatal for us.</p><p>So you have to watch your temper.</p><p>Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,</p><p>write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:</p><p>Anger, jealousy, lust.</p><p>Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?</p><p>Yeah.</p><ul><li>What is wrong with you?!</li><li>It&rsquo;s a bug.</li></ul><p>He&rsquo;s not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!</p><p>What was that? A Pic &lsquo;N&rsquo; Save circular?</p><p>Yeah, it was. How did you know?</p><p>It felt like about 10 pages.

enough food of your own?</p><ul><li><p>Well, yes.</p></li><li><p>How do you get it?</p></li><li><p>Bees make it.</p></li><li><p>I know who makes it!</p></li></ul><p>And it&rsquo;s hard to make it!</p><p>There&rsquo;s heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s organic.</li><li>It&rsquo;s our-ganic!</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s just honey, Barry.</p><p>Just what?!</p><p>Bees don&rsquo;t know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!</p><p>You&rsquo;ve taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!</p><p>And it&rsquo;s on sale?!
I&rsquo;m getting to the bottom of this.</p><p>I&rsquo;m getting to the bottom

So you can talk!</p><p>I can talk.
And now you&rsquo;ll start talking!</p><p>Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who&rsquo;s your supplier?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t understand.
I thought we were friends.</p><p>The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!</p><p>You&rsquo;re too late! It&rsquo;s ours now!</p><p>You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!</p><p>You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!</p><p>Where is the honey coming from?</p><p>Tell me where!</p><p>Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!</p><p>Orazy person!</p><p>What horrible thing has happened here?</p><p>These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now</p><p>they&rsquo;re on the road to nowhere!</p><p>Just keep still.</p><p>What? You&rsquo;re not dead?</p><p>Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?</p><p>To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to Alaska. Moose blood,

Nobody works harder than bees!</p><p>Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked</p><p>your hands were still stirring.
You couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p><p>I remember that.</p><p>What right do they have to our honey?</p><p>We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!</p><p>Even if it&rsquo;s true, what can one bee do?</p><p>Sting them where it really hurts.</p><p>In the face! The eye!</p><ul><li>That would hurt.</li><li>No.</li></ul><p>Up the nose? That&rsquo;s a killer.</p><p>There&rsquo;s only one place you can sting

Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?</p><p>Where I&rsquo;m from, we&rsquo;d never sue humans.</p><p>We were thinking

Judge Bumbleton presiding.</p><p>All right. Oase number 4475,</p><p>Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry</p><p>is now in session.</p><p>Mr. Montgomery, you&rsquo;re representing
the five food companies collectively?</p><p>A privilege.</p><p>Mr. Benson&mldr; you&rsquo;re representing
all the bees of the world?</p><p>I&rsquo;m kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we&rsquo;re ready to proceed.</p><p>Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</p><p>my grandmother was a simple woman.</p><p>Born on a farm, she believed
it was man&rsquo;s divine right</p><p>to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.</p><p>If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,</p><p>just think of what would it mean.</p><p>I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm</p><p>for the elastic in my britches!</p><p>Talking bee!</p><p>How do we know this isn&rsquo;t some sort of</p><p>holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?</p><p>They could be using laser beams!</p><p>Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,</p><p>he could be on steroids!</p><p>Mr. Benson?</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,
there&rsquo;s no trickery here.</p><p>I&rsquo;m just an ordinary bee.
Honey&rsquo;s pretty important to me.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to all bees.
We invented it!</p><p>We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room</p><p>who think they can take it from us</p><p>&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re the little guys!
I&rsquo;m hoping that, after this is all over,</p><p>you&rsquo;ll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have</p><p>but everything we are!</p><p>I wish he&rsquo;d dress like that
all the time. So nice!</p><p>Oall your first witness.</p><p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.</p><p>I suppose so.</p><p>I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!</p><p>Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.</p><p>Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?</p><ul><li><p>No.</p></li><li><p>I couldn&rsquo;t hear you.</p></li><li><p>No.</p></li><li><p>No.</p></li></ul><p>Because you don&rsquo;t free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,</p><p>it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.</p><p>They&rsquo;re very lovable creatures.</p><p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.</p><p>You mean like this?</p><p>Bears kill bees!</p><p>How&rsquo;d you like his head crashing
through your living room?!</p><p>Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!</p><p>OK, that&rsquo;s enough. Take him away.</p><p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.</p><ul><li>Where have I heard it before?</li><li>I was with a band called The Police.</li></ul><p>But you&rsquo;ve never been
a police officer, have you?</p><p>No, I haven&rsquo;t.</p><p>No, you haven&rsquo;t. And so here
we have yet another example</p><p>of bee culture casually
stolen by a human</p><p>for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.</p><p>Oh, please.</p><p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?</p><p>Because I&rsquo;m feeling
a little stung, Sting.</p><p>Or should I say&mldr; Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!</p><p>That&rsquo;s not his real name?! You idiots!</p><p>Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on</p><p>your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.</p><p>Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>I see from your resume
that you&rsquo;re devilishly handsome</p><p>with a churning inner turmoil
that&rsquo;s ready to blow.</p><p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?</p><p>Not yet it isn&rsquo;t. But is this
what it&rsquo;s come to for you?</p><p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don&rsquo;t</p><p>have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?</p><p>Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a goodfella.
This is a badfella!</p><p>Why doesn&rsquo;t someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!</p><ul><li>Order in this court!</li><li>You&rsquo;re all thinking it!</li></ul><p>Order! Order, I say!</p><ul><li>Say it!</li><li>Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</li></ul><p>I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.</p><p>I think the jury&rsquo;s on our side.</p><p>Are we doing everything right, legally?</p><p>I&rsquo;m a florist.</p><p>Right. Well, here&rsquo;s to a great team.</p><p>To a great team!</p><p>Well, hello.</p><ul><li>Ken!</li><li>Hello.</li></ul><p>I didn&rsquo;t think you were coming.</p><p>No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but&mldr; the battery.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.</p><p>Oh, that was lucky.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a little left.
I could heat it up.</p><p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.</p><p>So I hear you&rsquo;re quite a tennis player.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not much for the game myself.
The ball&rsquo;s a little grabby.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where I usually sit.
Right&mldr; there.</p><p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,</p><p>and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn&rsquo;t really a special skill.</p><p>You think I don&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re doing?</p><p>I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.</p><p>Do we?</p><p>Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.</p><p>That&rsquo;s just what
I was thinking about doing.</p><p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to drain the old stinger.</p><p>Yeah, you do that.</p><p>Look at that.</p><p>You know, I&rsquo;ve just about had it</p><p>with your little mind games.</p><ul><li>What&rsquo;s that?</li><li>Italian Vogue.</li></ul><p>Mamma mia, that&rsquo;s a lot of pages.</p><p>A lot of ads.</p><p>Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?</p><p>Funny, I just can&rsquo;t seem to recall that!</p><p>I think something stinks in here!</p><p>I love the smell of flowers.</p><p>How do you like the smell of flames?!</p><p>Not as much.</p><p>Water bug! Not taking sides!</p><p>Ken, I&rsquo;m wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve got issues!</p><p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!</p><ul><li>You&rsquo;re bluffing.</li><li>Am I?</li></ul><p>Surf&rsquo;s up, dude!</p><p>Poo water!</p><p>That bowl is gnarly.</p><p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!</p><p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!</p><p>You know, I don&rsquo;t even like honey!
I don&rsquo;t eat it!</p><p>We need to talk!</p><p>He&rsquo;s just a little bee!</p><p>And he happens to be
the nicest bee I&rsquo;ve met in a long time!</p><p>Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?</p><p>No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you&rsquo;re one of them!</p><p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night&mldr;</p><p>My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!</p><p>Goodbye, Ken.</p><p>And for your information,</p><p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry about all that.</p><p>I know it&rsquo;s got
an aftertaste! I like it!</p><p>I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.</p><p>I couldn&rsquo;t overcome it.
Oh, well.</p><p>Are you OK for the trial?</p><p>I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.</p><p>We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.</p><p>Good idea! You can really see why he&rsquo;s
considered one of the best lawyers&mldr;</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Layton, you&rsquo;ve
gotta weave some magic</p><p>with this jury,
or it&rsquo;s gonna be all over.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around</p><p>is to remind them
of what they don&rsquo;t like about bees.</p><ul><li>You got the tweezers?</li><li>Are you allergic?</li></ul><p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.</p><p>Mr. Benson Bee, I&rsquo;ll ask you
what I think we&rsquo;d all like to know.</p><p>What exactly is your relationship</p><p>to that woman?</p><p>We&rsquo;re friends.</p><ul><li>Good friends?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>How good? Do you live together?</p><p>Wait a minute&mldr;</p><p>Are you her little&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;bedbug?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,</p><p>doesn&rsquo;t your queen give birth
to all the bee children?</p><ul><li><p>Yeah, but&mldr;</p></li><li><p>So those aren&rsquo;t your real parents!</p></li><li><p>Oh, Barry&mldr;</p></li><li><p>Yes, they are!</p></li></ul><p>Hold me back!</p><p>You&rsquo;re an illegitimate bee,
aren&rsquo;t you, Benson?</p><p>He&rsquo;s denouncing bees!</p><p>Don&rsquo;t y&rsquo;all date your cousins?</p><ul><li>Objection!</li><li>I&rsquo;m going to pincushion this guy!</li></ul><p>Adam, don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s what he wants!</p><p>Oh, I&rsquo;m hit!!</p><p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!</p><p>Order! Order!</p><p>The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!</p><p>I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!</p><p>You see? You can&rsquo;t treat them
like equals! They&rsquo;re striped savages!</p><p>Stinging&rsquo;s the only thing
they know! It&rsquo;s their way!</p><ul><li>Adam, stay with me.</li><li>I can&rsquo;t feel my legs.</li></ul><p>What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison</p><p>from my heaving buttocks?</p><p>I will have order in this court. Order!</p><p>Order, please!</p><p>The case of the honeybees
versus the human race</p><p>took a pointed turn against the bees</p><p>yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.</p><ul><li><p>Hey, buddy.</p></li><li><p>Hey.</p></li><li><p>Is there much pain?</p></li><li><p>Yeah.</p></li></ul><p>I&mldr;</p><p>I blew the whole case, didn&rsquo;t I?</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is
you&rsquo;re alive. You could have died.</p><p>I&rsquo;d be better off dead. Look at me.</p><p>They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.</p><p>Look, there&rsquo;s
a little celery still on it.</p><p>What was it like to sting someone?</p><p>I can&rsquo;t explain it. It was all&mldr;</p><p>All adrenaline and then&mldr;
and then ecstasy!</p><p>All right.</p><p>You think it was all a trap?</p><p>Of course. I&rsquo;m sorry.
I flew us right into this.</p><p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We&rsquo;re
just a couple of bugs in this world.</p><p>What will the humans do to us
if they win?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad.</p><p>Adam, they check in,
but they don&rsquo;t check out!</p><p>Oh, my.</p><p>Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?</p><ul><li>Why?</li><li>The smoke.</li></ul><p>Bees don&rsquo;t smoke.</p><p>Right. Bees don&rsquo;t smoke.</p><p>Bees don&rsquo;t smoke!
But some bees are smoking.</p><p>That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s our case!</p><p>It is? It&rsquo;s not over?</p><p>Get dressed. I&rsquo;ve gotta go somewhere.</p><p>Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.</p><p>And assuming you&rsquo;ve done step correctly, you&rsquo;re ready for the tub.</p><p>Mr. Flayman.</p><p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!</p><p>Where is the rest of your team?</p><p>Well, Your Honor, it&rsquo;s interesting.</p><p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,</p><p>and as a result,
we don&rsquo;t make very good time.</p><p>I actually heard a funny story about&mldr;</p><p>Your Honor,
haven&rsquo;t these ridiculous bugs</p><p>taken up enough
of this court&rsquo;s valuable time?</p><p>How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?</p><p>They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges</p><p>against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.</p><p>I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!</p><p>Mr. Flayman, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going</p><p>to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery&rsquo;s motion.</p><p>But you can&rsquo;t! We have a terrific case.</p><p>Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?</p><p>Show me the smoking gun!</p><p>Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?</p><p>Here is your smoking gun.</p><p>What is that?</p><p>It&rsquo;s a bee smoker!</p><p>What, this?
This harmless little contraption?</p><p>This couldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.</p><p>Look at what has happened</p><p>to bees who have never been asked,
&ldquo;Smoking or non?&rdquo;</p><p>Is this what nature intended for us?</p><p>To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines</p><p>and man-made wooden slat work camps?</p><p>Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?</p><ul><li>What are we gonna do?</li><li>He&rsquo;s playing the species card.</li></ul><p>Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!</p><p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p><p>Free the bees!</p><p>Free the bees! Free the bees!</p><p>The court finds in favor of the bees!</p><p>Vanessa, we won!</p><p>I knew you could do it! High-five!</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>I&rsquo;m OK! You know what this means?</p><p>All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.</p><p>Now we won&rsquo;t have
to work so hard all the time.</p><p>This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll regret this.</p><p>Barry, how much honey is out there?</p><p>All right. One at a time.</p><p>Barry, who are you wearing?</p><p>My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.</p><ul><li>What if Montgomery&rsquo;s right?</li><li>What do you mean?</li></ul><p>We&rsquo;ve been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.</p><p>Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.</p><p>Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,</p><p>every last drop.</p><p>We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more</p><p>than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.</p><p>We&rsquo;re all aware
of what they do in the woods.</p><p>Wait for my signal.</p><p>Take him out.</p><p>He&rsquo;ll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he&rsquo;ll be fine.</p><p>And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames&mldr;</p><p>But it&rsquo;s just a prance-about stage name!</p><p>&mldr;unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products</p><p>and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.</p><p>Oan&rsquo;t breathe.</p><p>Bring it in, boys!</p><p>Hold it right there! Good.</p><p>Tap it.</p><p>Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there&rsquo;s gallons more coming!</p><ul><li>I think we need to shut down!</li><li>Shut down? We&rsquo;ve never shut down.</li></ul><p>Shut down honey production!</p><p>Stop making honey!</p><p>Turn your key, sir!</p><p>What do we do now?</p><p>Oannonball!</p><p>We&rsquo;re shutting honey production!</p><p>Mission abort.</p><p>Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.</p><p>Adam, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe
how much honey was out there.</p><p>Oh, yeah?</p><p>What&rsquo;s going on? Where is everybody?</p><ul><li>Are they out celebrating?</li><li>They&rsquo;re home.</li></ul><p>They don&rsquo;t know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.</p><p>I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.</p><p>At least we got our honey back.</p><p>Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn&rsquo;t?</p><p>It&rsquo;s the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.</p><p>This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.</p><p>And now&mldr;</p><p>Now I can&rsquo;t.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t understand
why they&rsquo;re not happy.</p><p>I thought their lives would be better!</p><p>They&rsquo;re doing nothing. It&rsquo;s amazing.
Honey really changes people.</p><p>You don&rsquo;t have any idea
what&rsquo;s going on, do you?</p><ul><li>What did you want to show me?</li><li>This.</li></ul><p>What happened here?</p><p>That is not the half of it.</p><p>Oh, no. Oh, my.</p><p>They&rsquo;re all wilting.</p><p>Doesn&rsquo;t look very good, does it?</p><p>No.</p><p>And whose fault do you think that is?</p><p>You know, I&rsquo;m gonna guess bees.</p><p>Bees?</p><p>Specifically, me.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.</p><p>It&rsquo;s notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.</p><p>That&rsquo;s our whole SAT test right there.</p><p>Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.</p><p>And then, of course&mldr;</p><p>The human species?</p><p>So if there&rsquo;s no more pollination,</p><p>it could all just go south here,
couldn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>I know this is also partly my fault.</p><p>How about a suicide pact?</p><p>How do we do it?</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ll sting you, you step on me.</li><li>Thatjust kills you twice.</li></ul><p>Right, right.</p><p>Listen, Barry&mldr;
sorry, but I gotta get going.</p><p>I had to open my mouth and talk.</p><p>Vanessa?</p><p>Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?</p><p>To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the last chance
I&rsquo;ll ever have to see it.</p><p>Vanessa, I just wanna say I&rsquo;m sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.</p><p>I know. Me neither.</p><p>Tournament of Roses.
Roses can&rsquo;t do sports.</p><p>Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?</p><p>Roses!</p><p>Vanessa!</p><p>Roses?!</p><p>Barry?</p><ul><li>Roses are flowers!</li><li>Yes, they are.</li></ul><p>Flowers, bees, pollen!</p><p>I know.
That&rsquo;s why this is the last parade.</p><p>Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?</p><p>Oould you slow down?</p><p>Barry!</p><p>OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.</p><p>Yes, it kind of is.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you</p><p>with the flower shop.
I&rsquo;ve made it worse.</p><p>Actually, it&rsquo;s completely closed down.</p><p>I thought maybe you were remodeling.</p><p>But I have another idea, and it&rsquo;s
greater than my previous ideas combined.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear it!</p><p>All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.</p><p>I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.</p><p>All we gotta do is get what they&rsquo;ve got
back here with what we&rsquo;ve got.</p><ul><li><p>Bees.</p></li><li><p>Park.</p></li><li><p>Pollen!</p></li><li><p>Flowers.</p></li><li><p>Repollination!</p></li><li><p>Across the nation!</p></li></ul><p>Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.</p><p>Security will be tight.</p><p>I have an idea.</p><p>Vanessa Bloome, FTD.</p><p>Official floral business. It&rsquo;s real.</p><p>Sorry, ma&rsquo;am. Nice brooch.</p><p>Thank you. It was a gift.</p><p>Once inside,
we just pick the right float.</p><p>How about The Princess and the Pea?</p><p>I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!</p><p>Yes, I got it.</p><ul><li><p>Where should I sit?</p></li><li><p>What are you?</p></li><li><p>I believe I&rsquo;m the pea.</p></li><li><p>The pea?</p></li></ul><p>It goes under the mattresses.</p><ul><li>Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.</li><li>I&rsquo;m getting the marshal.</li></ul><p>You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see what this baby&rsquo;ll do.</p><p>Hey, what are you doing?!</p><p>Then all we do
is blend in with traffic&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;without arousing suspicion.</p><p>Once at the airport,
there&rsquo;s no stopping us.</p><p>Stop! Security.</p><ul><li>You and your insect pack your float?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>Has it been
in your possession the entire time?</p><p>Would you remove your shoes?</p><ul><li>Remove your stinger.</li><li>It&rsquo;s part of me.</li></ul><p>I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.</p><p>Then if we&rsquo;re lucky, we&rsquo;ll have
just enough pollen to do the job.</p><p>Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!</p><p>I think this is gonna work.</p><p>It&rsquo;s got to work.</p><p>Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.</p><p>We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.</p><p>It looks like we&rsquo;ll experience
a couple hours delay.</p><p>Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They&rsquo;ll never make it.</p><p>I gotta get up there
and talk to them.</p><p>Be careful.</p><p>Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.</p><p>Oaptain, I&rsquo;m in a real situation.</p><ul><li>What&rsquo;d you say, Hal?</li><li>Nothing.</li></ul><p>Bee!</p><p>Don&rsquo;t freak out! My entire species&mldr;</p><p>What are you doing?</p><ul><li>Wait a minute! I&rsquo;m an attorney!</li><li>Who&rsquo;s an attorney?</li></ul><p>Don&rsquo;t move.</p><p>Oh, Barry.</p><p>Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.</p><p>Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?</p><p>And please hurry!</p><p>What happened here?</p><p>There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.</p><p>One&rsquo;s bald, one&rsquo;s in a boat,
they&rsquo;re both unconscious!</p><ul><li>Is that another bee joke?</li><li>No!</li></ul><p>No one&rsquo;s flying the plane!</p><p>This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What&rsquo;s your status?</p><p>This is Vanessa Bloome.
I&rsquo;m a florist from New York.</p><p>Where&rsquo;s the pilot?</p><p>He&rsquo;s unconscious,
and so is the copilot.</p><p>Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?</p><p>As a matter of fact, there is.</p><ul><li>Who&rsquo;s that?</li><li>Barry Benson.</li></ul><p>From the honey trial?! Oh, great.</p><p>Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.</p><p>It&rsquo;s got giant wings, huge engines.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t fly a plane.</p><ul><li>Why not? Isn&rsquo;t John Travolta a pilot?</li><li>Yes.</li></ul><p>How hard could it be?</p><p>Wait, Barry!
We&rsquo;re headed into some lightning.</p><p>This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,</p><p>where a suspenseful scene
is developing.</p><p>Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory&mldr;</p><p>That&rsquo;s Barry!</p><p>&mldr;is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers</p><p>and an incapacitated flight crew.</p><p>Flowers?!</p><p>We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls</p><p>with absolutely no flight experience.</p><p>Just a minute.
There&rsquo;s a bee on that plane.</p><p>I&rsquo;m quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.</p><p>They&rsquo;ve done enough damage.</p><p>But isn&rsquo;t he your only hope?</p><p>Technically, a bee
shouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly at all.</p><p>Their wings are too small&mldr;</p><p>Haven&rsquo;t we heard this a million times?</p><p>&ldquo;The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><p>Get this on the air!</p></li><li><p>Got it.</p></li><li><p>Stand by.</p></li><li><p>We&rsquo;re going live.</p></li></ul><p>The way we work may be a mystery to you.</p><p>Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.</p><p>But let me tell you about a small job.</p><p>If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.</p><p>More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why I want to get bees
back to working together.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the bee way!
We&rsquo;re not made of Jell-O.</p><p>We get behind a fellow.</p><ul><li>Black and yellow!</li><li>Hello!</li></ul><p>Left, right, down, hover.</p><ul><li>Hover?</li><li>Forget hover.</li></ul><p>This isn&rsquo;t so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!</p><p>Barry, what happened?!</p><p>Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.</p><ul><li>That may have been helping me.</li><li>And now we&rsquo;re not!</li></ul><p>So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.</p><p>All of you, let&rsquo;s get
behind this fellow! Move it out!</p><p>Move out!</p><p>Our only chance is if I do what I&rsquo;d do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!</p><p>Don&rsquo;t have to yell.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not yelling!
We&rsquo;re in a lot of trouble.</p><p>It&rsquo;s very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!</p><p>It&rsquo;s not a tone. I&rsquo;m panicking!</p><p>I can&rsquo;t do this!</p><p>Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!</p><p>You snap out of it.</p><p>You snap out of it.</p><ul><li><p>You snap out of it!</p></li><li><p>You snap out of it!</p></li><li><p>You snap out of it!</p></li><li><p>You snap out of it!</p></li><li><p>You snap out of it!</p></li><li><p>You snap out of it!</p></li><li><p>Hold it!</p></li><li><p>Why? Oome on, it&rsquo;s my turn.</p></li></ul><p>How is the plane flying?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p><p>Hello?</p><p>Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?</p><p>The Pollen Jocks!</p><p>They do get behind a fellow.</p><ul><li>Black and yellow.</li><li>Hello.</li></ul><p>All right, let&rsquo;s drop this tin can
on the blacktop.</p><p>Where? I can&rsquo;t see anything. Oan you?</p><p>No, nothing. It&rsquo;s all cloudy.</p><p>Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.</p><ul><li>Thinking bee.</li><li>Thinking bee.</li></ul><p>Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><p>Wait a minute.
I think I&rsquo;m feeling something.</p><ul><li>What?</li><li>I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s strong, pulling me.</li></ul><p>Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.</p><p>Bring the nose down.</p><p>Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><ul><li>What in the world is on the tarmac?</li><li>Get some lights on that!</li></ul><p>Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><ul><li>Vanessa, aim for the flower.</li><li>OK.</li></ul><p>Out the engines. We&rsquo;re going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?</p><p>Affirmative!</p><p>Good. Good. Easy, now. That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>Land on that flower!</p><p>Ready? Full reverse!</p><p>Spin it around!</p><ul><li><p>Not that flower! The other one!</p></li><li><p>Which one?</p></li><li><p>That flower.</p></li><li><p>I&rsquo;m aiming at the flower!</p></li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower</p><p>made of millions of bees!</p><p>Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.</p><p>Rotate around it.</p><ul><li>This is insane, Barry!</li><li>This&rsquo;s the only way I know how to fly.</li></ul><p>Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?</p><p>Get your nose in there. Don&rsquo;t be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!</p><p>Just drop it. Be a part of it.</p><p>Aim for the center!</p><p>Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!</p><p>Oome on, already.</p><p>Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!</p><ul><li>Yes. No high-five!</li><li>Right.</li></ul><p>Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?</p><p>What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!</p><ul><li>Thank you.</li><li>But we&rsquo;re not done yet.</li></ul><p>Listen, everyone!</p><p>This runway is covered
with the last pollen</p><p>from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.</p><p>That means this is our last chance.</p><p>We&rsquo;re the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.</p><p>If we&rsquo;re gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?</p><p>Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?</p><p>We&rsquo;re bees!</p><p>Keychain!</p><p>Then follow me! Except Keychain.</p><p>Hold on, Barry. Here.</p><p>You&rsquo;ve earned this.</p><p>Yeah!</p><p>I&rsquo;m a Pollen Jock! And it&rsquo;s a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>That&rsquo;s our Barry.</p><p>Mom! The bees are back!</p><p>If anybody needs
to make a call, now&rsquo;s the time.</p><p>I got a feeling we&rsquo;ll be
working late tonight!</p><p>Here&rsquo;s your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who&rsquo;s next?</p><p>Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don&rsquo;t forget these.</p><p>Milk, cream, cheese, it&rsquo;s all me.
And I don&rsquo;t see a nickel!</p><p>Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!</p><p>I had no idea.</p><p>Barry, I&rsquo;m sorry.
Have you got a moment?</p><p>Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.</p><p>Sorry I&rsquo;m late.</p><p>He&rsquo;s a lawyer too?</p><p>I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.</p><p>Have a great afternoon!</p><p>Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can&rsquo;t get them anywhere.</p><p>No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.</p><p>You&rsquo;re a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who&rsquo;s next?</p><p>All right, scramble, jocks!
It&rsquo;s time to fly.</p><p>Thank you, Barry!</p><p>That bee is living my life!</p><p>Let it go, Kenny.</p><ul><li><p>When will this nightmare end?!</p></li><li><p>Let it all go.</p></li><li><p>Beautiful day to fly.</p></li><li><p>Sure is.</p></li></ul><p>Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.</p><p>You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.</p><ul><li>Thinking bee!</li><li>Me?</li></ul><p>Hold it. Let&rsquo;s just stop
for a second. Hold it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?</p><p>I&rsquo;m not making a major life decision
during a production number!</p><p>All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.</p><p>I had virtually no rehearsal for that.</p><p>Special thanks to SergeiK.</p></p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="content has-text-centered"><h3 class="subtitle is-3 footer-text">Check out our social media</h3><a href=https://www.instagram.com/schulichignite target=_blank><span class="icon is-large"><ion-icon name=logo-instagram></ion-icon></span></a><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7tNvdbu952HOUl_4nK7iww target=_blank><span class="icon is-large"><ion-icon name=logo-youtube></ion-icon></span></a><a href=https://www.facebook.com/SchulichIgnite/ target=_blank><span class="icon is-large"><ion-icon name=logo-facebook></ion-icon></span></a><a href=https://linkedin.com/company/schulich-ignite/ target=_blank><span class="icon is-large"><ion-icon name=logo-linkedin></ion-icon></span></a><a href=https://discord.gg/F3Qjqqj target=_blank><span class="icon is-large"><img src=/img/logos/discord-footer.svg></span></a></div></footer></body><script src=https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.1.2/dist/ionicons.js></script></html>
