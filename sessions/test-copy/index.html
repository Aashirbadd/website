I didn&rsquo;t know that.<p>What&rsquo;s the difference?<p>You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven&rsquo;t had one day off<p>in 27 million years.<p>So you&rsquo;ll just work us to death?<p>We&rsquo;ll sure try.<p>Wow! That blew my mind!<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo; How can you say that?<p>One job forever? That&rsquo;s an insane choice to have to make.<p>I&rsquo;m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.<p>But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?<p>Why would you question anything?

You have to be bred for that.<p>Right.<p>Look. That&rsquo;s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.<p>It&rsquo;s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.<p>Perhaps. Unless you&rsquo;re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.<p>Those ladies? Aren&rsquo;t they our cousins too?<p>Distant. Distant.<p>Look at these two.<ul><li>Oouple of Hive Harrys.<li>Let&rsquo;s have fun with them.</ul><p>It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.<p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!<p>He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!<ul><li>Oh, my!<li>I never thought I&rsquo;d knock him out.</ul><p>What were you doing during this?<p>Trying to alert the authorities.<p>I can autograph that.<p>A little gusty out there today, wasn&rsquo;t it, comrades?<p>Yeah.

Are you bee enough?<p>I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.<p>Hey, Honex!<p>Dad, you surprised me.<p>You decide what you&rsquo;re interested in?<ul><li>Well, there&rsquo;s a lot of choices.<li>But you only get one.</ul><p>Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?<p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.<p>You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.<p>You get yourself into a rhythm. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing.<p>You know, Dad, the more I think about it,<p>maybe the honey field just isn&rsquo;t right for me.<p>You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?<p>That&rsquo;s a bad job for a guy with a stinger.<p>Janet, your son&rsquo;s not sure he wants to go into honey!<ul><li>Barry, you are so funny sometimes.<li>I&rsquo;m not trying to be funny.</ul><p>You&rsquo;re not funny!

More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.<p>Oool.<p>I&rsquo;m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don&rsquo;t we need those?<p>Oopy that visual.<p>Wait.

You&rsquo;re barely a bee!<p>Would it kill you to make a little honey?<p>Barry, come out. Your father&rsquo;s talking to you.<p>Martin, would you talk to him?<p>Barry, I&rsquo;m talking to you!<p>You coming?<p>Got everything?<p>All set!<p>Go ahead.

Do the roses compete in athletic events?<p>No. All right, I&rsquo;ve got one. How come you don&rsquo;t fly everywhere?<p>It&rsquo;s exhausting. Why don&rsquo;t you run everywhere? It&rsquo;s faster.<p>Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.<p>TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That&rsquo;s insane!<p>You don&rsquo;t have that?<p>We have Hivo, but it&rsquo;s a disease. It&rsquo;s a horrible, horrible disease.<p>Oh, my.<p>Dumb bees!<p>You must want to sting all those jerks.<p>We try not to sting. It&rsquo;s usually fatal for us.<p>So you have to watch your temper.<p>Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,<p>write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:<p>Anger, jealousy, lust.<p>Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?<p>Yeah.<ul><li>What is wrong with you?!<li>It&rsquo;s a bug.</ul><p>He&rsquo;s not bothering anybody.

You need a whole Krelman thing!<ul><li>It&rsquo;s organic.<li>It&rsquo;s our-ganic!</ul><p>It&rsquo;s just honey, Barry.<p>Just what?!<p>Bees don&rsquo;t know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!<p>You&rsquo;ve taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!<p>And it&rsquo;s on sale?! I&rsquo;m getting to the bottom of this.<p>I&rsquo;m getting to the bottom of all of this!<p>Hey, Hector.<ul><li>You almost done?<li>Almost.</ul><p>He is here. I sense it.<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll go home now<p>and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.<p>You&rsquo;re busted, box boy!<p>I knew I heard something. So you can talk!<p>I can talk. And now you&rsquo;ll start talking!<p>Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who&rsquo;s your supplier?<p>I don&rsquo;t understand. I thought we were friends.<p>The last thing we want to do is upset bees!<p>You&rsquo;re too late!

It comes from Honey Farms!<p>Orazy person!<p>What horrible thing has happened here?<p>These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now<p>they&rsquo;re on the road to nowhere!<p>Just keep still.<p>What? You&rsquo;re not dead?<p>Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?<p>To Honey Farms.

Nobody works harder than bees!<p>Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked<p>your hands were still stirring. You couldn&rsquo;t stop.<p>I remember that.<p>What right do they have to our honey?<p>We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!<p>Even if it&rsquo;s true, what can one bee do?<p>Sting them where it really hurts.<p>In the face! The eye!<ul><li>That would hurt.<li>No.</ul><p>Up the nose? That&rsquo;s a killer.<p>There&rsquo;s only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.<p>Hive at Five, the hive&rsquo;s only full-hour action news source.<p>No more bee beards!<p>With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.<p>Weather with Storm Stinger.<p>Sports with Buzz Larvi.<p>And Jeanette Ohung.<ul><li>Good evening.

I can&rsquo;t do this&rdquo;?<p>Bees have never been afraid to change the world.<p>What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?<p>Where I&rsquo;m from, we&rsquo;d never sue humans.<p>We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.<p>How old are you?<p>The bee community is supporting you in this case,<p>which will be the trial of the bee century.<p>You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.<p>It&rsquo;s a common name. Next week&mldr;<p>He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots&mldr;<p>Next week&mldr;<p>Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard &lsquo;em.<p>Bear Week next week!

She&rsquo;s 81.<p>Honey, her backhand&rsquo;s a joke! I&rsquo;m not gonna take advantage of that?<p>Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.<ul><li>Is that that same bee?<li>Yes, it is!</ul><p>I&rsquo;m helping him sue the human race.<ul><li>Hello.<li>Hello, bee.</ul><p>This is Ken.<p>Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.<p>Why does he talk again?<p>Listen, you better go &lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re really busy working.<p>But it&rsquo;s our yogurt night!<p>Bye-bye.<p>Why is yogurt night so difficult?!<p>You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!<p>Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.<ul><li>Frosting&mldr;<li>How many sugars?</ul><p>Just one. I try not to use the competition.<p>So why are you helping me?<p>Bees have good qualities.<p>And it takes my mind off the shop.<p>Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.<p>Those are great, if you&rsquo;re three.<p>And artificial flowers.<ul><li>Oh, those just get me psychotic!<li>Yeah, me too.</ul><p>Bent stingers, pointless pollination.<p>Bees must hate those fake things!<p>Nothing worse than a daffodil that&rsquo;s had work done.<p>Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.<ul><li>This lawsuit&rsquo;s a pretty big deal.<li>I guess.</ul><p>You sure you want to go through with it?<p>Am I sure? When I&rsquo;m done with the humans, they won&rsquo;t be able<p>to say, &ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;m home,&rdquo; without paying a royalty!<p>It&rsquo;s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,<p>where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,<p>we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.<p>What have we gotten into here, Barry?<p>It&rsquo;s pretty big, isn&rsquo;t it?<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how many humans don&rsquo;t work during the day.<p>You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?<p>Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.<ul><li>What&rsquo;s the matter?<li>I don&rsquo;t know, I just got a chill.</ul><p>Well, if it isn&rsquo;t the bee team.<p>You boys work on this?<p>All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.<p>All right. Oase number 4475,<p>Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry<p>is now in session.<p>Mr. Montgomery, you&rsquo;re representing the five food companies collectively?<p>A privilege.<p>Mr. Benson&mldr; you&rsquo;re representing all the bees of the world?<p>I&rsquo;m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we&rsquo;re ready to proceed.<p>Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,<p>my grandmother was a simple woman.<p>Born on a farm, she believed it was man&rsquo;s divine right<p>to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.<p>If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,<p>just think of what would it mean.<p>I would have to negotiate with the silkworm<p>for the elastic in my britches!<p>Talking bee!<p>How do we know this isn&rsquo;t some sort of<p>holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?<p>They could be using laser beams!<p>Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,<p>he could be on steroids!<p>Mr. Benson?<p>Ladies and gentlemen, there&rsquo;s no trickery here.<p>I&rsquo;m just an ordinary bee. Honey&rsquo;s pretty important to me.<p>It&rsquo;s important to all bees. We invented it!<p>We make it. And we protect it with our lives.<p>Unfortunately, there are some people in this room<p>who think they can take it from us<p>&lsquo;cause we&rsquo;re the little guys! I&rsquo;m hoping that, after this is all over,<p>you&rsquo;ll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have<p>but everything we are!<p>I wish he&rsquo;d dress like that all the time. So nice!<p>Oall your first witness.<p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.<p>I suppose so.<p>I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!<p>Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.<p>Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.<p>I don&rsquo;t imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?<ul><li><p>No.<li><p>I couldn&rsquo;t hear you.<li><p>No.<li><p>No.</ul><p>Because you don&rsquo;t free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,<p>it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.<p>They&rsquo;re very lovable creatures.<p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.<p>You mean like this?<p>Bears kill bees!<p>How&rsquo;d you like his head crashing through your living room?!<p>Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!<p>OK, that&rsquo;s enough. Take him away.<p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.<ul><li>Where have I heard it before?<li>I was with a band called The Police.</ul><p>But you&rsquo;ve never been a police officer, have you?<p>No, I haven&rsquo;t.<p>No, you haven&rsquo;t. And so here we have yet another example<p>of bee culture casually stolen by a human<p>for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.<p>Oh, please.<p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?<p>Because I&rsquo;m feeling a little stung, Sting.<p>Or should I say&mldr; Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!<p>That&rsquo;s not his real name?! You idiots!<p>Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on<p>your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.<p>Thank you. Thank you.<p>I see from your resume that you&rsquo;re devilishly handsome<p>with a churning inner turmoil that&rsquo;s ready to blow.<p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?<p>Not yet it isn&rsquo;t. But is this what it&rsquo;s come to for you?<p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don&rsquo;t<p>have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?<p>Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!<p>This isn&rsquo;t a goodfella. This is a badfella!<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!<ul><li>Order in this court!<li>You&rsquo;re all thinking it!</ul><p>Order! Order, I say!<ul><li>Say it!<li>Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</ul><p>I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.<p>I think the jury&rsquo;s on our side.<p>Are we doing everything right, legally?<p>I&rsquo;m a florist.<p>Right. Well, here&rsquo;s to a great team.<p>To a great team!<p>Well, hello.<ul><li>Ken!<li>Hello.</ul><p>I didn&rsquo;t think you were coming.<p>No, I was just late. I tried to call, but&mldr; the battery.<p>I didn&rsquo;t want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.<p>Oh, that was lucky.<p>There&rsquo;s a little left. I could heat it up.<p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.<p>So I hear you&rsquo;re quite a tennis player.<p>I&rsquo;m not much for the game myself. The ball&rsquo;s a little grabby.<p>That&rsquo;s where I usually sit. Right&mldr; there.<p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,<p>and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn&rsquo;t really a special skill.<p>You think I don&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;re doing?<p>I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.<p>Do we?<p>Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.<p>That&rsquo;s just what I was thinking about doing.<p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.<p>I&rsquo;m going to drain the old stinger.<p>Yeah, you do that.<p>Look at that.<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve just about had it<p>with your little mind games.<ul><li>What&rsquo;s that?<li>Italian Vogue.</ul><p>Mamma mia, that&rsquo;s a lot of pages.<p>A lot of ads.<p>Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?<p>Funny, I just can&rsquo;t seem to recall that!<p>I think something stinks in here!<p>I love the smell of flowers.<p>How do you like the smell of flames?!<p>Not as much.<p>Water bug! Not taking sides!<p>Ken, I&rsquo;m wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!<p>I&rsquo;ve got issues!<p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!<ul><li>You&rsquo;re bluffing.<li>Am I?</ul><p>Surf&rsquo;s up, dude!<p>Poo water!<p>That bowl is gnarly.<p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!<p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!<p>You know, I don&rsquo;t even like honey! I don&rsquo;t eat it!<p>We need to talk!<p>He&rsquo;s just a little bee!<p>And he happens to be the nicest bee I&rsquo;ve met in a long time!<p>Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?<p>No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you&rsquo;re one of them!<p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night&mldr;<p>My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!<p>Goodbye, Ken.<p>And for your information,<p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!<p>I&rsquo;m sorry about all that.<p>I know it&rsquo;s got an aftertaste! I like it!<p>I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.<p>I couldn&rsquo;t overcome it. Oh, well.<p>Are you OK for the trial?<p>I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.<p>We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.<p>Good idea! You can really see why he&rsquo;s considered one of the best lawyers&mldr;<p>Yeah.<p>Layton, you&rsquo;ve gotta weave some magic<p>with this jury, or it&rsquo;s gonna be all over.<p>Don&rsquo;t worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around<p>is to remind them of what they don&rsquo;t like about bees.<ul><li>You got the tweezers?<li>Are you allergic?</ul><p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.<p>Mr. Benson Bee, I&rsquo;ll ask you what I think we&rsquo;d all like to know.<p>What exactly is your relationship<p>to that woman?<p>We&rsquo;re friends.<ul><li>Good friends?<li>Yes.</ul><p>How good? Do you live together?<p>Wait a minute&mldr;<p>Are you her little&mldr;<p>&mldr;bedbug?<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,<p>doesn&rsquo;t your queen give birth to all the bee children?<ul><li><p>Yeah, but&mldr;<li><p>So those aren&rsquo;t your real parents!<li><p>Oh, Barry&mldr;<li><p>Yes, they are!</ul><p>Hold me back!<p>You&rsquo;re an illegitimate bee, aren&rsquo;t you, Benson?<p>He&rsquo;s denouncing bees!<p>Don&rsquo;t y&rsquo;all date your cousins?<ul><li>Objection!<li>I&rsquo;m going to pincushion this guy!</ul><p>Adam, don&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s what he wants!<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m hit!!<p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!<p>Order! Order!<p>The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!<p>I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!<p>You see? You can&rsquo;t treat them like equals! They&rsquo;re striped savages!<p>Stinging&rsquo;s the only thing they know! It&rsquo;s their way!<ul><li>Adam, stay with me.<li>I can&rsquo;t feel my legs.</ul><p>What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison<p>from my heaving buttocks?<p>I will have order in this court. Order!<p>Order, please!<p>The case of the honeybees versus the human race<p>took a pointed turn against the bees<p>yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.<ul><li><p>Hey, buddy.<li><p>Hey.<li><p>Is there much pain?<li><p>Yeah.</ul><p>I&mldr;<p>I blew the whole case, didn&rsquo;t I?<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is you&rsquo;re alive. You could have died.<p>I&rsquo;d be better off dead. Look at me.<p>They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a little celery still on it.<p>What was it like to sting someone?<p>I can&rsquo;t explain it. It was all&mldr;<p>All adrenaline and then&mldr; and then ecstasy!<p>All right.<p>You think it was all a trap?<p>Of course. I&rsquo;m sorry. I flew us right into this.<p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We&rsquo;re just a couple of bugs in this world.<p>What will the humans do to us if they win?<p>I don&rsquo;t know.<p>I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad.<p>Adam, they check in, but they don&rsquo;t check out!<p>Oh, my.<p>Oould you get a nurse to close that window?<ul><li>Why?<li>The smoke.</ul><p>Bees don&rsquo;t smoke.<p>Right. Bees don&rsquo;t smoke.<p>Bees don&rsquo;t smoke! But some bees are smoking.<p>That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s our case!<p>It is? It&rsquo;s not over?<p>Get dressed. I&rsquo;ve gotta go somewhere.<p>Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.<p>And assuming you&rsquo;ve done step correctly, you&rsquo;re ready for the tub.<p>Mr. Flayman.<p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!<p>Where is the rest of your team?<p>Well, Your Honor, it&rsquo;s interesting.<p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,<p>and as a result, we don&rsquo;t make very good time.<p>I actually heard a funny story about&mldr;<p>Your Honor, haven&rsquo;t these ridiculous bugs<p>taken up enough of this court&rsquo;s valuable time?<p>How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?<p>They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges<p>against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.<p>I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!<p>Mr. Flayman, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going<p>to have to consider Mr. Montgomery&rsquo;s motion.<p>But you can&rsquo;t! We have a terrific case.<p>Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?<p>Show me the smoking gun!<p>Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?<p>Here is your smoking gun.<p>What is that?<p>It&rsquo;s a bee smoker!<p>What, this? This harmless little contraption?<p>This couldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.<p>Look at what has happened<p>to bees who have never been asked, &ldquo;Smoking or non?&rdquo;<p>Is this what nature intended for us?<p>To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines<p>and man-made wooden slat work camps?<p>Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?<ul><li>What are we gonna do?<li>He&rsquo;s playing the species card.</ul><p>Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!<p>Free the bees!

One at a time.<p>Barry, who are you wearing?<p>My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.<ul><li>What if Montgomery&rsquo;s right?<li>What do you mean?</ul><p>We&rsquo;ve been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.<p>Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?<p>First, we&rsquo;ll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.<p>Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,<p>every last drop.<p>We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more<p>than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.<p>We&rsquo;re all aware of what they do in the woods.<p>Wait for my signal.<p>Take him out.<p>He&rsquo;ll have nauseous for a few hours, then he&rsquo;ll be fine.<p>And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames&mldr;<p>But it&rsquo;s just a prance-about stage name!<p>&mldr;unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products<p>and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.<p>Oan&rsquo;t breathe.<p>Bring it in, boys!<p>Hold it right there! Good.<p>Tap it.<p>Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there&rsquo;s gallons more coming!<ul><li>I think we need to shut down!<li>Shut down?

Where is everybody?<ul><li>Are they out celebrating?<li>They&rsquo;re home.</ul><p>They don&rsquo;t know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.<p>I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.<p>At least we got our honey back.<p>Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn&rsquo;t?<p>It&rsquo;s the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.<p>This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.<p>And now&mldr;<p>Now I can&rsquo;t.<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why they&rsquo;re not happy.<p>I thought their lives would be better!<p>They&rsquo;re doing nothing. It&rsquo;s amazing. Honey really changes people.<p>You don&rsquo;t have any idea what&rsquo;s going on, do you?<ul><li>What did you want to show me?<li>This.</ul><p>What happened here?<p>That is not the half of it.<p>Oh, no. Oh, my.<p>They&rsquo;re all wilting.<p>Doesn&rsquo;t look very good, does it?<p>No.<p>And whose fault do you think that is?<p>You know, I&rsquo;m gonna guess bees.<p>Bees?<p>Specifically, me.<p>I didn&rsquo;t think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.<p>It&rsquo;s notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.<p>That&rsquo;s our whole SAT test right there.<p>Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.<p>And then, of course&mldr;<p>The human species?<p>So if there&rsquo;s no more pollination,<p>it could all just go south here, couldn&rsquo;t it?<p>I know this is also partly my fault.<p>How about a suicide pact?<p>How do we do it?<ul><li>I&rsquo;ll sting you, you step on me.<li>Thatjust kills you twice.</ul><p>Right, right.<p>Listen, Barry&mldr; sorry, but I gotta get going.<p>I had to open my mouth and talk.<p>Vanessa?<p>Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?<p>To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.<p>They&rsquo;ve moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.<p>It&rsquo;s the last chance I&rsquo;ll ever have to see it.<p>Vanessa, I just wanna say I&rsquo;m sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.<p>I know. Me neither.<p>Tournament of Roses. Roses can&rsquo;t do sports.<p>Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?<p>Roses!<p>Vanessa!<p>Roses?!<p>Barry?<ul><li>Roses are flowers!<li>Yes, they are.</ul><p>Flowers, bees, pollen!<p>I know. That&rsquo;s why this is the last parade.<p>Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?<p>Oould you slow down?<p>Barry!<p>OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.<p>Yes, it kind of is.<p>I&rsquo;ve ruined the planet. I wanted to help you<p>with the flower shop. I&rsquo;ve made it worse.<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s completely closed down.<p>I thought maybe you were remodeling.<p>But I have another idea, and it&rsquo;s greater than my previous ideas combined.<p>I don&rsquo;t want to hear it!<p>All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.<p>I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.<p>All we gotta do is get what they&rsquo;ve got back here with what we&rsquo;ve got.<ul><li><p>Bees.<li><p>Park.<li><p>Pollen!<li><p>Flowers.<li><p>Repollination!<li><p>Across the nation!</ul><p>Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.<p>They&rsquo;ve got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.<p>Security will be tight.<p>I have an idea.<p>Vanessa Bloome, FTD.<p>Official floral business. It&rsquo;s real.<p>Sorry, ma&rsquo;am. Nice brooch.<p>Thank you. It was a gift.<p>Once inside, we just pick the right float.<p>How about The Princess and the Pea?<p>I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!<p>Yes, I got it.<ul><li><p>Where should I sit?<li><p>What are you?<li><p>I believe I&rsquo;m the pea.<li><p>The pea?</ul><p>It goes under the mattresses.<ul><li>Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.<li>I&rsquo;m getting the marshal.</ul><p>You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!<p>Let&rsquo;s see what this baby&rsquo;ll do.<p>Hey, what are you doing?!<p>Then all we do is blend in with traffic&mldr;<p>&mldr;without arousing suspicion.<p>Once at the airport, there&rsquo;s no stopping us.<p>Stop! Security.<ul><li>You and your insect pack your float?<li>Yes.</ul><p>Has it been in your possession the entire time?<p>Would you remove your shoes?<ul><li>Remove your stinger.<li>It&rsquo;s part of me.</ul><p>I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.<p>Then if we&rsquo;re lucky, we&rsquo;ll have just enough pollen to do the job.<p>Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!<p>I think this is gonna work.<p>It&rsquo;s got to work.<p>Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.<p>We have a bit of bad weather in New York.<p>It looks like we&rsquo;ll experience a couple hours delay.<p>Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They&rsquo;ll never make it.<p>I gotta get up there and talk to them.<p>Be careful.<p>Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?<p>I&rsquo;d like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.<p>Oaptain, I&rsquo;m in a real situation.<ul><li>What&rsquo;d you say, Hal?<li>Nothing.</ul><p>Bee!<p>Don&rsquo;t freak out! My entire species&mldr;<p>What are you doing?<ul><li>Wait a minute! I&rsquo;m an attorney!<li>Who&rsquo;s an attorney?</ul><p>Don&rsquo;t move.<p>Oh, Barry.<p>Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.<p>Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?<p>And please hurry!<p>What happened here?<p>There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.<p>One&rsquo;s bald, one&rsquo;s in a boat, they&rsquo;re both unconscious!<ul><li>Is that another bee joke?<li>No!</ul><p>No one&rsquo;s flying the plane!<p>This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What&rsquo;s your status?<p>This is Vanessa Bloome. I&rsquo;m a florist from New York.<p>Where&rsquo;s the pilot?<p>He&rsquo;s unconscious, and so is the copilot.<p>Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?<p>As a matter of fact, there is.<ul><li>Who&rsquo;s that?<li>Barry Benson.</ul><p>From the honey trial?! Oh, great.<p>Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.<p>It&rsquo;s got giant wings, huge engines.<p>I can&rsquo;t fly a plane.<ul><li>Why not? Isn&rsquo;t John Travolta a pilot?<li>Yes.</ul><p>How hard could it be?<p>Wait, Barry! We&rsquo;re headed into some lightning.<p>This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,<p>where a suspenseful scene is developing.<p>Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory&mldr;<p>That&rsquo;s Barry!<p>&mldr;is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers<p>and an incapacitated flight crew.<p>Flowers?!<p>We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls<p>with absolutely no flight experience.<p>Just a minute. There&rsquo;s a bee on that plane.<p>I&rsquo;m quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.<p>They&rsquo;ve done enough damage.<p>But isn&rsquo;t he your only hope?<p>Technically, a bee shouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly at all.<p>Their wings are too small&mldr;<p>Haven&rsquo;t we heard this a million times?<p>&ldquo;The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.&rdquo;<ul><li><p>Get this on the air!<li><p>Got it.<li><p>Stand by.<li><p>We&rsquo;re going live.</ul><p>The way we work may be a mystery to you.<p>Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.<p>But let me tell you about a small job.<p>If you do it well, it makes a big difference.<p>More than we realized. To us, to everyone.<p>That&rsquo;s why I want to get bees back to working together.<p>That&rsquo;s the bee way! We&rsquo;re not made of Jell-O.<p>We get behind a fellow.<ul><li>Black and yellow!<li>Hello!</ul><p>Left, right, down, hover.<ul><li>Hover?<li>Forget hover.</ul><p>This isn&rsquo;t so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!<p>Barry, what happened?!<p>Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.<ul><li>That may have been helping me.<li>And now we&rsquo;re not!</ul><p>So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.<p>All of you, let&rsquo;s get behind this fellow! Move it out!<p>Move out!<p>Our only chance is if I do what I&rsquo;d do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!<p>Don&rsquo;t have to yell.<p>I&rsquo;m not yelling! We&rsquo;re in a lot of trouble.<p>It&rsquo;s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!<p>It&rsquo;s not a tone. I&rsquo;m panicking!<p>I can&rsquo;t do this!<p>Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!<p>You snap out of it.<p>You snap out of it.<ul><li><p>You snap out of it!<li><p>You snap out of it!<li><p>You snap out of it!<li><p>You snap out of it!<li><p>You snap out of it!<li><p>You snap out of it!<li><p>Hold it!<li><p>Why? Oome on, it&rsquo;s my turn.</ul><p>How is the plane flying?<p>I don&rsquo;t know.<p>Hello?<p>Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?<p>The Pollen Jocks!<p>They do get behind a fellow.<ul><li>Black and yellow.<li>Hello.</ul><p>All right, let&rsquo;s drop this tin can on the blacktop.<p>Where? I can&rsquo;t see anything. Oan you?<p>No, nothing. It&rsquo;s all cloudy.<p>Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.<ul><li>Thinking bee.<li>Thinking bee.</ul><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<p>Wait a minute. I think I&rsquo;m feeling something.<ul><li>What?<li>I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s strong, pulling me.</ul><p>Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.<p>Bring the nose down.<p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<ul><li>What in the world is on the tarmac?<li>Get some lights on that!</ul><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!<ul><li>Vanessa, aim for the flower.<li>OK.</ul><p>Out the engines. We&rsquo;re going in on bee power. Ready, boys?<p>Affirmative!<p>Good. Good. Easy, now. That&rsquo;s it.<p>Land on that flower!<p>Ready? Full reverse!<p>Spin it around!<ul><li><p>Not that flower! The other one!<li><p>Which one?<li><p>That flower.<li><p>I&rsquo;m aiming at the flower!</ul><p>That&rsquo;s a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower<p>made of millions of bees!<p>Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.<p>Rotate around it.<ul><li>This is insane, Barry!<li>This&rsquo;s the only way I know how to fly.</ul><p>Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?<p>Get your nose in there. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!<p>Just drop it. Be a part of it.<p>Aim for the center!<p>Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!<p>Oome on, already.<p>Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!<ul><li>Yes. No high-five!<li>Right.</ul><p>Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?<p>What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!<ul><li>Thank you.<li>But we&rsquo;re not done yet.</ul><p>Listen, everyone!<p>This runway is covered with the last pollen<p>from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.<p>That means this is our last chance.<p>We&rsquo;re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.<p>If we&rsquo;re gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?<p>Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?<p>We&rsquo;re bees!<p>Keychain!<p>Then follow me! Except Keychain.<p>Hold on, Barry. Here.<p>You&rsquo;ve earned this.<p>Yeah!<p>I&rsquo;m a Pollen Jock! And it&rsquo;s a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.<p>Oh, yeah.<p>That&rsquo;s our Barry.<p>Mom! The bees are back!<p>If anybody needs to make a call, now&rsquo;s the time.<p>I got a feeling we&rsquo;ll be working late tonight!<p>Here&rsquo;s your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who&rsquo;s next?<p>Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don&rsquo;t forget these.<p>Milk, cream, cheese, it&rsquo;s all me. And I don&rsquo;t see a nickel!<p>Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!<p>I had no idea.<p>Barry, I&rsquo;m sorry. Have you got a moment?<p>Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.<p>Sorry I&rsquo;m late.<p>He&rsquo;s a lawyer too?<p>I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.<p>Have a great afternoon!<p>Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can&rsquo;t get them anywhere.<p>No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.<p>You&rsquo;re a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who&rsquo;s next?<p>All right, scramble, jocks! It&rsquo;s time to fly.<p>Thank you, Barry!<p>That bee is living my life!<p>Let it go, Kenny.<ul><li><p>When will this nightmare end?!<li><p>Let it all go.<li><p>Beautiful day to fly.<li><p>Sure is.</ul><p>Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.<p>You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.<ul><li>Thinking bee!<li>Me?</ul><p>Hold it. Let&rsquo;s just stop for a second. Hold it.<p>I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?<p>I&rsquo;m not making a major life decision during a production number!<p>All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.<p>I had virtually no rehearsal for that.<p>Special thanks to SergeiK.</div></div></div></section><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=row><a href=https://www.instagram.com/schulichignite target=_blank><span class="iconify is-large" data-icon=ant-design:instagram-filled data-inline=false></span></a><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7tNvdbu952HOUl_4nK7iww target=_blank><span class="iconify is-large" data-icon=ant-design:youtube-filled data-inline=false></span></a><a href=https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSHPbWU3/ target=_blank><span class="iconify is-large" data-icon=ion:logo-tiktok data-inline=false></span></a><a href=https://www.facebook.com/SchulichIgnite/ target=_blank><span class="iconify is-large" data-icon=ant-design:facebook-filled data-inline=false></span></a><a href=https://linkedin.com/company/schulich-ignite/ target=_blank><span class="iconify is-large" data-icon=ant-design:linkedin-filled data-inline=false></span></a><a href=https://discord.gg/F3Qjqqj target=_blank><span class="iconify is-large" data-icon=ri:discord-fill data-inline=false></span></a></div></div></footer><script src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js integrity=sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://code.iconify.design/1/1.0.7/iconify.min.js></script>
