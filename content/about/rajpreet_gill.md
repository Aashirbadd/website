My name is Rajpreet Gill and I am the VP Events at Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for planning, managing, and executing events. This incorporates organizing the Schulich Ignite Gala and managing collaborations with other clubs. I am also a mentor with Schulich Ignite. A fun fact about me: I would love to have a house in the countryside and own a horse one day (I love horseback riding)!
