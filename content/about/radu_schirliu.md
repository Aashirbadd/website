My name is Radu Schirliu, and I am the VP of Content Development for Schulich Ignite. I am responsible for creating all of the teaching materials and examples that are used during the sessions. I am also a mentor, and one of the people working on the Ignite website! Fun fact about me: I first started trying to learn how to code when I was in grade 6.
