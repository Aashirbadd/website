tagline: "Schulich Ignite is a club at the University of Calgary that aims to ignite a passion for coding in youth! We have helped over 1000 students learn how to code and have been teaching since 2016. We offer free, introductory Python workshops to high school students where they are able to explore the fundamentals of coding in a fun and interactive environment. Our workshops are unique in that all of our students are connected with mentors from the University of Calgary. Our mentors offer one-on-one support to enhance their students’ learning experience and offer their mentees insight into their experience as students in tech!
