Through the Schulich Ignite program, you will be able to develop basic coding skills, along with problem-solving skills. Our lectures will teach you how to think outside of the box when solving complex coding problems. Moreover, you will be able to see content from first year university courses, giving you a head start. The Schulich Ignite program is a great way to learn a new skill, meet other students, and develop friendships!
