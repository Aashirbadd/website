question: "How will the Fall 2020 Sessions be Run?"
---

Fall sessions will take place online through Zoom, and our platform will be used to code with ease. A mentor will still be assigned 2-4 mentees, and we will have breakout rooms for collaboration. You may ask the lecture lead questions as well through the “raise a hand” feature, or simply by typing in the chat!
